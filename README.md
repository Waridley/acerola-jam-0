# Καιροι

(I use modern Greek pronunciation, and thus say it like "keh-ri", but I 
don't mind if you call it "kai-roy")

This game prototype was made for
[Acerola Jam #0](https://itch.io/jam/acerola-jam-0)

I had a few emergencies come up during the jam, so I was not able to do 
nearly as much as I had in mind. However, I am happy that I was able to 
submit *something.* 

The goal of the introductory puzzle is simply to escape the room, after 
which there *would* be more content if I had more time. As it is, consider 
yourself to have won the game if you escape, and move on to other entries :)

All assets were made by me, except for the Bevy and jam logos, and builtin font

under something like Creative Commons later.
